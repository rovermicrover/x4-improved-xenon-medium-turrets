# About

The Xenon medium pulse laser turret is weaker than any of the other race's. The Xenon large pulse laser turret on the other hand is three times as powerful as the other races with some loss in speed.

This mod aims to fix the problem by making the Xenon medium pulse laser turret twice as powerful as the other race's.

Note this should make it harder to solo Xenon Capital ships by making their medium turrets something to actually be feared.
